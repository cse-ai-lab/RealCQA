# RealCQA
## Scientific Chart Question Answering as a Test-bed for First-Order Logic

### [Arxiv Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01979.pdf)

Existing datasets in chart visual QA either are fully synthetic charts generated from synthetic data (right sector) or synthetic charts generated from real data (left sector). 

None of these datasets handle the complexity of the distribution of real-world charts found in scientific literature. 

We introduce the first chart QA dataset (RealCQA) in the third category (lower sector) which consists of real-world charts extracted from scientific papers along with various categories of QA pairs.
